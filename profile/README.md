I'm Marco Ivaldi, a seasoned security researcher and tech leader with [25+ years](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/author/191/) of experience, specializing in offensive security, from old school X.25 to modern mobile apps. I work as technical director at [HN Security](https://security.humanativaspa.it/), a boutique company I co-founded that provides tailored offensive security services. 

As a polyglot programmer of [weird machines](https://www.exploit-db.com/?author=315), I study [how things can go wrong](https://how.complexsystems.fail/). I'm a core developer of the [OSSTMM](http://www.osstmm.org/), the international standard for security testing. I've published many articles in various computing magazines, including [Phrack](http://phrack.org/issues/70/13.html#article), and I've co-authored some books, such as the popular [Hacking Exposed Linux](https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Exposed-Linux/dp/0072262575). I've presented my research at prestigious international conferences, including [Infiltrate](https://web.archive.org/web/20230601160755/https://infiltratecon.com/). I've recently earned the title of [Most Valuable Security Researcher](https://www.credly.com/users/raptor) from Microsoft and I've attended their exclusive [Zero Day Quest](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/microsoft-zero-day-quest) event. Back in the '90s, I co-founded [Linux&C](https://0xdeadbeef.info/stuff/lc0.jpg), the first Italian magazine about Linux and the open source movement.

I write code mainly in:
