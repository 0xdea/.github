I'm Marco Ivaldi, a seasoned security researcher and tech leader with [over 25 years](https://web.archive.org/web/20240616125351/https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/author/191/) in offensive security. As a polyglot programmer of [weird machines](https://www.exploit-db.com/?author=315), I study [how things can go wrong](https://how.complexsystems.fail/). I've hacked on everything from old-school X.25 networks to modern mobile apps. These days, I'm the technical director and co-founder of [HN Security](https://hnsecurity.it/), a boutique firm specializing in tailored security assessments.

My journey began in the '90s, when I co-founded [Linux&C](https://0xdeadbeef.info/stuff/lc0.jpg), the very first Italian magazine about Linux and open source. Along the way, I've contributed to the [OSSTMM](https://www.isecom.org/research.html), published in magazines like [Phrack](http://phrack.org/issues/70/13.html#article), co-authored several books including [Hacking Exposed Linux](https://www.hackinglinuxexposed.com/), and presented my research at international conferences such as [Infiltrate](https://web.archive.org/web/20230601160755/https://infiltratecon.com/). In recognition of my contributions I was recently named a [Most Valuable Security Researcher](https://www.credly.com/users/raptor) by Microsoft and have competed as a [Zero Day Quest](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/msrc/microsoft-zero-day-quest) hacker.

I write code mainly in:
