## Who's Raptor?

I'm a seasoned security researcher and tech leader with [25 years](https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/author/191/) of experience, specializing in offensive security, from old school X.25 to modern mobile apps. I work as technical director at [HN Security](https://security.humanativaspa.it/), a boutique company I co-founded that provides tailored offensive security services. 

As a [hacker](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/H/hacker.html) and polyglot programmer of [weird machines](https://www.exploit-db.com/?author=315), I study [how things can go wrong](https://how.complexsystems.fail/). I'm a core developer of the Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual ([OSSTMM](http://www.osstmm.org/)), the international standard for security testing. I've published many articles in various computing magazines, including [Phrack](http://phrack.org/issues/70/13.html#article), and I've co-authored some books, such as the popular [Hacking Exposed Linux](https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Exposed-Linux/dp/0072262575). I recently earned the title of [Most Valuable Security Researcher](https://msrc.microsoft.com/blog/2024/08/congratulations-to-the-msrc-2024-most-valuable-security-researchers/) from Microsoft. Back in the 1990s, I co-founded [Linux&C](https://0xdeadbeef.info/stuff/lc0.jpg), the first Italian magazine about Linux and the open source movement.

I write code in the following languages:
* Rust
* C
* Assembly
* Python
* Go
* Java
* JavaScript
* C++
* Perl
* TCL-Expect
* Shell
* And more...
